# How Much more Violent is Mexico since you were born?

Chema Galvez

## Goal

My goal is to show Mexico's violenc though time. Create an impact on how thing have been evolving
and that people do not normalize what has been happening for almost two decades now.

I initially was planning on doing one big interactive followed by an article but now the idea is to make
most of the point visually with just small cards-like quick information that support the vizualizations

## Data Challenges

All the data being use is final data

## Questions

{Numbered list of questions for course staff, if any.}

1. I'm thinking on swaping the area graph with the histogram but would like opinions on that
2. If you see think the theme I'm using is correct. Because it's homicides red is the most premanent color
but maybe you would advise too add some other?
3. I'm really interested as foreign if you see any information or data that may be unclear or that could be 
subjet to misinterpretation
